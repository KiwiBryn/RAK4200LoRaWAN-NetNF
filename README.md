# RAK4200LoRaWAN-NetNF
A C# library for [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) connectivity for [RAKwireless](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us) [RAK4200 Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4200-lora-module) equipped [.NET nanoFramework](https://www.nanoframework.net/) powered devices.

This repo has the source code for the series of blog posts written as I work on the library

I used a local [RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-edge/products/rak7258-micro-gateway) connected to [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) to test my implementation.
